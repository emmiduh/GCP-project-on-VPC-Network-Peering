# GCP-project-on-VPC-Network-Peering

## In this project, I:
* Created up two VPC networks with a subnet, a vm instance and a firewall rule in each of them. Both networks are in separate projects.
* Configured peering in both directions between the VPC in the project to the=at in the second project.
* Tested connectivity between the two vms in each project, which was successful
